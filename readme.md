# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

## Day 1

Solved in Google Sheets, because Chen said "Oh, I don't need to learn Python for this, I can just do it in Excel!"

Impression of the first part:

```
=ABS(A1-B1)
=SUM(C:C)
```

Impression of the second part:

```
=countif(B:B,A1)
=A1*C1
=SUM(D:D)
```

## Day 2

Solved the first part in Google Sheets, because I wanted to see how far I'd get with it :P But then quickly realized I'd already hit that end when I saw the bonus challenge..

Impression of the first part:

```
=AND(MAP($A11:$G11, $B11:$H11, LAMBDA(a, b, IF(b, a<b, true))))
=AND(MAP($A11:$G11, $B11:$H11, LAMBDA(a, b, IF(b, a>b, true))))
=AND(MAP($A11:$G11, $B11:$H11, LAMBDA(a, b, IF(b, AND(abs(a-b) >= 1, abs(a-b) <= 3), true))))
=and(or(J11:K11),L11)
=COUNTIF(M:M,true)
```

For the bonus part I turned to Gleam, because that seemed fun. However, while using the language, I started to get turned off, because they seem to have an inclination to follow "ergonomic functional-style" syntax ... and .. let's be honest, it's simply the same but less ergonomic than .. Adventlang! :D So then afterwards I also coded the first part in Adventlang for comparison. (The bonus would be a bit harder, I might need to add more stuff to the stdlib.)

Side-by-side:

## Day 3, 4, 5

Fun and not too easy -- except day 5's bonus, which was actually quite the surpise for me. I don't know whether I was juist brainfarting, or it was actually so hard, but it took me quite some iterations :P

## Day 6

Today was a bad day for Adventlang..

- A found a bug that must have been in AL for a long time already:

  ```al
  let a = 1
  let u = (4, a)
  b = 2
  // u is now (4, 2) but should still be (4, 1)
  ```

  the simple solution is to sprinkle some `:clone`s throughout the code for now ðŸ˜“

- There's a syntax / parsing bug, where it doesn't recognize this code:

  ```al
  if (a, b) == (1, 5) {
    ...
  }
  ```

- And, to put the nail in the coffin, it was suuper slow in computing, and eventually ate too much memory to be able to complete, the bonus part of today's challenge.

..so I took to Rust to solve the bonus part. My brute force solution is of course not the most beautiful way of solving it, and there'll most definitely be a way to solve the whole thing way faster, and then also in AL, but .. oh well..
